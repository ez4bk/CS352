# CS352
This is the collection of our independent solutions to assignments from Rutgers CS352 - Internet Technology Class in Fall 2022. The accessbility of this repository is maintained private until the end of the semester.\
### Warning
For students from the future, please do not hard copy the solution from us. If you really need help with your assignments, please read and understand the code first.
## Project 1 - Warm Up
This project includes a client and a server. The client reads text lines from a text file and sends them to the server. The server reverses the text and writes them to another text file.
## Project 2 - Asynchronous Sockets
Implementing a client sending DNS queries(client.py), a load-balancing server(ls.py), and two top-level DNS servers(ts1.py and ts2.py). The client and TSs are using socket while the LS is using selector to listen two both TSs at the same time. More information is in the pdf file in the project directory.
