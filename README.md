# CS352
This is the collection of our independent solutions to assignments from Rutgers CS352 - Internet Technology Class in Fall 2022. The accessbility of this repository is maintained private until the end of the semester.\
### Warning
For students from the future, please do not hard copy the solution from us. If you really need help with your assignments, please read and understand the code first.
## Project 1 - Warm Up
This project includes a client and a server. The client reads text lines from a text file and sends them to the server. The server reverses the text and writes them to another text file.
